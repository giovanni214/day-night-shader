# Day/Night World Map Renderer (Rust Version)

This is the original Rust/SFML implementation of the day/night shader service. It provides a high-performance HTTP API that renders a world map with a day/night terminator based on a given sun position.

> **Looking for the Node.js version?**
> This implementation is available on the [`node` branch](https://github.com/giovanni214/day-night-shader/tree/node).

## Local Installation & Usage

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following installed on your system:

-   **Rust Toolchain:** Must be [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
-   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
-   **SFML Development Libraries:** Required for compilation.
    -   On Debian/Ubuntu/WSL:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y libsfml-dev build-essential
        ```

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository and build the release executable.

```bash
# Clone the entire repository
git clone https://github.com/giovanni214/day-night-shader.git

# Navigate into the new directory
cd day-night-shader

# Build the release binary. The first build will take a while.
cargo build --release --bin day-night-shader-native
```

### 3. Running the Server

Start the application from your terminal. The compiled binary is located in the `target/release/` directory.

```bash
./target/release/day-night-shader-native
```

By default, the server will start and listen on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Using the API

Once the server is running, you can test the API endpoint. It accepts `lat` and `lon` as query parameters and returns a PNG image.

#### **Example with a Web Browser:**

Simply navigate to a URL with the desired coordinates.

-   **Sun over the Equator at the Prime Meridian:**
    `http://localhost:3000/?lat=0&lon=0`

-   **Sun over New York City (approx. 40.7째 N, 74째 W):**
    `http://localhost:3000/?lat=40.7&lon=-74`

#### **Example with `curl`:**

You can use a command-line tool like `curl` to fetch and save the image.

```bash
# Sun over Tokyo (approx. 35.7째 N, 139.7째 E)
curl "http://localhost:3000/?lat=35.7&lon=139.7" -o tokyo.png
```
This will save the rendered image as `tokyo.png` in your current directory.

## Docker Deployment

For a clean, portable deployment, you can use the included `Dockerfile`.

> **Note on SFML and Docker:**
> SFML is a graphical library that requires a display server to create a rendering context. The provided `Dockerfile` cleverly works around this on a headless server by installing and running **Xvfb** (X Virtual Framebuffer), a virtual display server that runs in memory.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

From the root of the project directory (on the `main` branch), run:

```bash
docker build -t day-night-shader-rust .
```

### 2. Run the Container

This command runs the server and maps your local port 3000 to the container's port 3000.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 day-night-shader-rust
```
-   `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it stops.
-   `-it`: Runs in interactive mode so you can see logs and stop with `Ctrl+C`.
-   `-p 3000:3000`: Maps the host port to the container port.

The container will automatically start `Xvfb` and then launch the application, listening on `0.0.0.0:3000` by default.

---

## Configuration

You can customize the server's behavior by passing command-line arguments when running the binary or when running the Docker container.

| Flag | Alias | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--addr` | `-a` | `127.0.0.1:3000` | The IP address and port to listen on. |
| `--width` | `-w` | `1400` | The width of the rendered PNG image in pixels. |

### Docker Configuration Examples

-   **Run on a different port and set a custom render width:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -it day-night-shader-rust day-night-shader-native -a 0.0.0.0:8080 -w 2048
    ```
