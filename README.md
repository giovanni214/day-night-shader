This project is a backend service that provides a powerful image rendering API. It takes a latitude and longitude representing the subsolar point (where the sun is directly overhead) and uses a custom GLSL shader to render a high-quality equirectangular map of the Earth. The final image accurately visualizes the terminator line, separating day from night, and includes distinct lines for civil, nautical, and astronomical twilight.

This version is built with Node.js, using the Express web server and the `gl` library for native OpenGL graphics. It is architected for high-throughput by offloading all GPU-intensive rendering to a separate worker thread, ensuring the web server's event loop is never blocked.

> **Looking for the original Rust/SFML version?**
> This implementation is available on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/giovanni214/day-night-shader/tree/main).

## Local Installation & Usage

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following installed on your system:

-   **Node.js:** Version 20.x or later is recommended.
-   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
-   **System Build Tools:** Required to compile the native `gl` dependency.
    -   On Debian/Ubuntu/WSL:
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config python-is-python3
        ```

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository and install the required NPM packages.

```bash
# Clone the entire repository
git clone https://github.com/giovanni214/day-night-shader.git

# Navigate into the new directory
cd day-night-shader

# IMPORTANT: Switch to the Node.js version
git checkout node

# Install all Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### 3. Running the Server

Start the application from your terminal.

```bash
node server.js
```

By default, the server will start and listen on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Using the API

Once the server is running, you can test the API endpoint. It accepts `lat` and `lon` as query parameters and returns a PNG image.

#### **Example with a Web Browser:**

Simply navigate to a URL with the desired coordinates.

-   **Sun over the Equator at the Prime Meridian:**
    `http://localhost:3000/?lat=0&lon=0`

-   **Sun over New York City (approx. 40.7째 N, 74째 W):**
    `http://localhost:3000/?lat=40.7&lon=-74`

#### **Example with `curl`:**

You can use a command-line tool like `curl` to fetch and save the image.

```bash
# Sun over Tokyo (approx. 35.7째 N, 139.7째 E)
curl "http://localhost:3000/?lat=35.7&lon=139.7" -o tokyo.png
```
This will save the rendered image as `tokyo.png` in your current directory.

## Docker Deployment

For a clean, portable deployment, you can use the included `Dockerfile`.

> **Note on Headless Rendering:**
> This version uses the `gl` package, which leverages native EGL for true headless rendering. Unlike the Rust/SFML version, it **does not** require a virtual display server like Xvfb.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

From the root of the project directory (on the `node` branch), run:

```bash
docker build -t day-night-shader-node .
```

### 2. Run the Container

This command runs the server and maps your local port 3000 to the container's port 3000.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 day-night-shader-node
```
-   `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it stops.
-   `-it`: Runs in interactive mode so you can see logs and stop with `Ctrl+C`.
-   `-p 3000:3000`: Maps the host port to the container port.

The container will start the application listening on `0.0.0.0:3000` by default.

---

## Configuration

You can customize the server's behavior by passing command-line arguments when running `node server.js` or when running the Docker container.

| Flag | Alias | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--port` | `-p` | `PORT` | `3000` | The port for the server to listen on. |
| `--address` | `-a` | | `0.0.0.0` | The network address to bind to. |
| `--width` | `-w` | | `1400` | The width of the rendered PNG image in pixels. |
| `--debug` | `-d` | | `false` | Enables verbose diagnostic logging. |

### Docker Configuration Examples

-   **Run on a different port and set a custom render width:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 -it day-night-shader-node node server.js --width 2048
    ```

-   **Run with debug logging enabled:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -it day-night-shader-node node server.js --debug
    ```
